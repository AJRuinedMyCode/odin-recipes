            <Li>1/3 cup water</Li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp margarine</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 lbs ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 egg,beaten</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
         <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Prepare pastry: Combine flour, curry powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut in margarine and shortening until mixture
         resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. Shape dough into a log and cut it into 10 equal pieces.
         Roll each piece into a 6-inch circle (approximately 1/8-inch thick) on a lightly floured surface; set aside.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Prepare filling: Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Saut√© onion until soft and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. 
        Stir in ground beef; season with curry powder, thyme, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until beef is evenly browned,
         8 to 10 minutes. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs. Simmer until liquid is absorbed; remove from heat.</p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Spoon equal amounts of filling onto each pastry circle. Fold over and press edges together, making a half-circle. Use the back of a 
            fork to seal edges, then brush tops with beaten egg. Place pastries on a baking sheet.</p>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes.</p>
